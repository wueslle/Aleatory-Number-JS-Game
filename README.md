# Aleatory-Number-JS-Game
Aleatory Number JS Game made as a study based on MDN instructions with some HTML/CSS changes

It is basically the same code from <a src"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash"> MDN </a> but I added some CSS and a sub page in english (index.html is in portuguese)
